# Customer Sentiment and Risk Intelligence System

Analyzing 15,599 customer support conversations to identify pain points, emotional patterns, and escalation risks that impact business outcomes.

## What This Does

Customer support generates massive conversation data, but patterns in customer frustration, confusion, and escalation risks often go unnoticed. This project extracts actionable signals from real support interactions, showing exactly where customers struggle and which service areas need immediate fixes.

The system analyzes messages for sentiment, emotional states, confusion levels, and risk severity, then visualizes these through dashboards that help teams prioritize improvements before issues escalate.

## Dataset Components

Working with customer messages analyzed across multiple dimensions:

- Sentiment classification (positive, neutral, negative)
- Emotional states (angry, confused, happy, mixed)
- Risk scoring (low to high severity)
- Signal features (punctuation patterns, question frequency, readability scores)
- Behavioral flags (complaints, urgency indicators, frustration markers)
- Topic categorization (service departments and workflows)

Processing includes pivot analysis for pattern discovery, readability metrics, and conditional formatting for quick insights.

## Key Findings

**Emotional Patterns**
Mixed emotions dominate, revealing inconsistent service quality. Confusion shows the highest severity, driven by unclear processes and complicated workflows. Reservations, ticketing, and general service have the most risk exposure.

**Critical Problem Areas**
General customer service carries the highest complaint load with elevated severity scores, pointing to systemic resolution delays. Billing and refunds show high confusion paired with poor readability, customers don't understand the policies. Anger clusters appear in complaint-heavy topics, creating escalation potential.

## Business Impact

The analysis translates directly to operational fixes:

- High confusion in billing means policies need simplified language and clearer documentation
- Negative sentiment in general tickets indicates workflow redesign or better routing is needed
- Mixed sentiment in reservations suggests inconsistent agent performance requiring standardization
- Anger in complaint areas shows communication breakdowns that proactive clarity could prevent

## Why This Matters

This project goes beyond basic sentiment labeling. It diagnoses specific customer experience problems and converts conversational data into prioritized action items.

The dashboards provide instant visibility into friction points, connecting emotional patterns to business metrics like complaints and escalations. It demonstrates the complete analytics workflow: from messy text data to executive-ready insights that drive decisions.

Technical components include feature engineering from unstructured text, multi-dimensional risk assessment, cross-sectional pivot analysis, and visualization design focused on actionability over complexity.

## Deliverables

- Cleaned dataset with engineered sentiment, emotion, and behavioral features
- Two comprehensive dashboards (sentiment-emotion patterns, risk-problem analysis)
- Pivot tables revealing topic-level performance and risk distribution
- Business recommendations mapped to specific service areas

Built to show how data analytics converts voice-of-customer into operational strategy with measurable impact.
